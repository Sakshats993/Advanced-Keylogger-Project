# 🛡️ Advanced Keylogging Concepts – Academic Internship Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is an **academic internship project** developed under faculty mentorship to **study, analyze, and understand keylogging techniques from a cybersecurity and defensive research perspective**.

The goal of this project is **educational** — to help students understand:

* How keystroke monitoring *can* work at a conceptual level
* The **security risks** posed by such techniques
* How **endpoint protection systems** detect and prevent misuse

⚠️ **This project is strictly intended for academic learning and controlled laboratory environments only.**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Study keystroke capture mechanisms at a **theoretical and proof-of-concept level**
* Understand secure data handling and encryption concepts
* Learn how stealth techniques are **detected and mitigated** by modern security solutions
* Promote **ethical cybersecurity practices** and awareness

---

## 🧩 Project Structure

The repository is organized to reflect a **modular research design**, allowing each component to be studied independently.
